What have I programmed?

This code is a Python program that reads data from a CSV file of financial transactions and calculates the sum of all transaction amounts for a given month.


Why did I build it?

The "Finance Manager" code was created with the aim of assisting my mother in managing her grocery expenses, as she was experiencing difficulties in sticking to a budget. In order to solve this problem, I developed a program that can read and analyze transaction data from a CSV file, and provide a summary of the total expenses incurred in a given month. This allowed my mother to gain a better understanding of her spending habits and make more informed decisions when it comes to budgeting for groceries.

I find it very fulfilling to build programs that can solve real-world problems, and the "Finance Manager" code is a great example of this. By leveraging technology to automate the analysis of financial transactions, I was able to create a tool that can help people manage their finances more effectively and make better decisions about how to allocate their resources.
